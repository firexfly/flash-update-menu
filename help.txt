Option 1
This option is used to update Adobe Flash Player. If Flash Player is not
already installed, it will install it.

The version of Flash Player you want to install or upgrade to needs to be
provided. You can find it here https://www.adobe.com/uk/software/flash/about/
or, if you already have Flash Player installed, look for the Flash Player
preferences (it may be in the Preferences menu), go to the advance tab and
click the check now button under updates; this will take you to the same web
page as above. You will find a table with the Flash Player versions; copy and
paste the Firefox for Linux version number into the terminal that the script
opens. The table on the Flash Player website looks something like this:
+-------+---------------------------------------------------+----------------+
| Linux | Mozilla, Firefox-NPAPI (Extended Support Release) | Player version |
+-------+---------------------------------------------------+----------------+

To complete the upgrade/installation, you must enter the password for your user
and press enter to accept. You will not see the characters or asterisks when
you type in your password; this is normal, your password is still being entered.

The script will return to the main menu when complete.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option 2
This is the recommended way to update all the software on the system (apart
from Flash Player). This option will never install additional software or
remove software that is no longer required. If an upgrade is necessary but
additional software needs to be installed, the upgrade will be held back using
this option; in that case you will need to use Option 3 --- dist-upgrade.

For more information on the commands behind this option check out the man page

man apt-get

The options in this command are:
update and upgrade.

The script will return to the main menu when complete.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Option 3
This option will upgrade the software on your system and intelligently install
or remove any software which is required or no longer required. It may also
upgrade you to the latest distribution of Debian when it becomes availabe. This
may be what you want but make sure you are ready for such a massive upgrade
before undertaking it.

For a start:
Back up valuable data
Read the release notes on https://www.debian.org/
Have plenty of time on your hands

For more information on the commands behind this option check out the man page

man apt-get

The options in this command are:
update and dist-upgrade.
